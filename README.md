# Decision-Tree-Model
This project implements a Decision Tree algorithm with pruning using a movie dataset. The model predicts outcomes by splitting data based on feature values to form a tree structure. Pruning is applied to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
